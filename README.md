# Problem Statement
You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with 'n' nodes, numbered from '0' to 'n-1'. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where 'graph[i]' is a list of tuples '(j, w)', representing an edge from node 'i' to node 'j' with weight 'w'. Your task is to find the 'longest path' in the graph starting from any node.
